* 在 YouTube 的 The School of Life channel 看到的，记下一些有趣的点。

## Philosophical Meditation

* About twenty minutes every few days.
* First: 
    * Accumulate a list of concerns you haven't looked at head on, but have glimpsed in the course of the day.
* Three questions:
    * what am i currently anxious about? all the detailed.
    * what am i upset about and whom? like talk to a patient friend.
        * what other explanations might there be for the hurt they have caused?
        * if this has happened to a friend, how would you advise him?
    * what am i currently excited and ambitious about?
        * what would it be to change your life in the light like this?
        * what might be missing in your life?
        * if this thing could change your life, what changes might it advise?
        * if other parts of your life were more like this, what might they be like?
* Philosophical Meditation helps us by creating an occasion where we can identify our thoughts, and get them in some kind of order, and to know ourself properly.

## How to be Confident

* Take yourself as a fool, and start to make mistakes

## Self-Esteem

* The result of understanding our past and the dynamic shame, conditionality and humiliation that might lie there. 
* High-Esteem seems largely to be prize of psychology rather than the fruit of anything we might achieve out of the world in relation the economy.
