## Introduction

Large Language Models(LLMs) has become an increasingly hot topic since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language understanding tasks, making them a hot topic in the field of artificial intelligence. We believe that embracing this innovation, and integrating it into our products will not only offer invaluable features to our customers, but also elevate us to a leading position among our competitors.

This report aims to offer an in-depth understanding of LLMs and their potential implications for product development. It starts with a foundational introduction to language models and a comparative analysis of the most recent LLMs in the market. Subsequently, there is a detailed exploration of the underlying technology propelling LLM-based products.

## Background

>"It seems probable that once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. ... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control." - Alan Turing, 1951

As we stand on the threshold of a new era, Alan Turing's visionary statement echoes through the annals of artificial intelligence. Today, machines have transitioned from being mere tools to becoming intelligent collaborators. They now possess capabilities to understand complex instructions, generate insightful reports, and even engage in human-like dialogue.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are central to this transformative journey. These AI models are capable of understanding and generating human language, thereby propelling a new wave of applications and services. From customer service chatbots to AI writing assistants, LLMs are redefining our perception of technology's potential. Turing's vision invites us to not only marvel at these advancements but also contemplate the implications and responsibilities that come with increasingly intelligent machines.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Language Models(LMs)

This transformative journey of machines becoming conversational partners is made possible by a field of AI known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP focuses on the intricate interaction between computers and human language, aiming to enable computers to comprehend, interpret, and generate language that is contextually meaningful and valuable.

A core component of NLP is the development and use of language models. These are AI models trained on vast repositories of text data, which enable them to learn and internalize the statistical patterns and relationships between words and phrases. By predicting the likelihood of a given sequence of words appearing in a text, language models are capable of generating text that is strikingly human-like.

Over the years, two primary training approaches have emerged in the realm of language models. The first involves training a model to specialize in a specific task, such as machine translation. While this can yield high performance for that task, it may limit the model's capacity to generalize to other tasks.

In contrast, the second approach focuses on training a model to be proficient across an array of tasks. Here, a general-purpose model is trained on a large corpus of text and then fine-tuned for specific tasks as needed, yielding a more versatile model that performs well across a broad spectrum of tasks. In recent years, we've observed that general-purpose models often struggle to match the performance of task-specific models. However, with the advent of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), especially GPT-4[^1], this trend may no longer hold true,

Earlier this year, Tencent conducted an experiment to evaluate ChatGPT's performance on machine translation[^2]. They found that although ChatGPT couldn't quite match the performance of established translation tools like Google Translate and DeepL, it was not far behind, particularly the GPT-4 variant.

Building on this, a team from Microsoft undertook a thorough experiment to assess the same task. Their results aligned with Tencent's findings, but with an interesting twist. They delved deeper to understand why GPT scored lower on various evaluations, and found that LLMs tend to be more paraphrastic and expand world knowledge, which isn't necessarily rewarded by existing evaluation metrics (some examples are provided below)[^3]. This led them to advocate for the development of refined metrics to enable a more accurate evaluation of these general-purpose LMs.

### The Era of General-Purpose LLMs

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-50.png" width=75% />

Since the groundbreaking paper "Attention Is All You Need[^4]" was unveiled in 2017, the landscape of NLP models has seen a significant shift towards the Transformer architecture. This architecture has become a cornerstone for most Large Language Models (LLMs), including pivotal models such as BERT[^5] and GPT[^6]. Over time, these models have grown in size, with GPT-4[^1] currently considered to be one of the largest language models, boasting more than 1 trillion parameters. The exact size, however, has not been disclosed by OpenAI, leaving room for speculation.

The question that naturally arises is, why have language models been growing so rapidly in size? The answer lies in the relationship between model size, dataset size, computational resources, and performance. Research indicates that performance consistently improves with increases in these factors[^7]. An intriguing aspect of this scaling process is the emergence of new abilities in larger models, abilities not seen in their smaller counterparts. This phenomenon is referred to as "emergence"[^8]. For instance, larger models show significantly enhanced performance in few-shot learning tasks, where models make predictions based on a limited number of examples.

But emergence is not limited to task performance alone. It also encompasses new prompting strategies that begin to outperform traditional approaches once a certain model size is achieved. This is illustrated in the paper "_Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models_"[^8] through eight distinct NLP tasks. In the corresponding plots (see below), the performance of the language model initially appears random, but as the scale increases, clear emergent abilities start to become evident.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-51.png" width=75% />

However, there is no standard definition for what constitutes a "large" language model. The scale at which a model begins to exhibit emergent abilities can vary significantly. This variability underscores the complexity and adaptability of large language models, thus advocating for their ongoing exploration and development.

One challenge arises when observing that a model doesn't instantly acquire the ability to generate the correct answer once it reaches a certain size. But rather, it incrementally gets closer to the right answer with each step, and the final correct response only comes more often once the model has reached a particular size. However, it's crucial to note that the accuracy of the reasoning process leading to the final correct answer was not evaluated in the paper.(can't find the paper)

### LLMs in Comparison

As of May 30th, 2023, a variety of LLMs have garnered significant attention. The following table provides a comparative overview of some popular models:

- The quality serves as a reference point only, as the performance of the model can differ depending on the specific task. To learn more about elo rating system, please refer to this blog: <https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/>

OpenAI's GPT-4 remains a market leader in performance, and it appears poised to hold this position in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, the AI landscape is in constant flux, with emerging contenders like Google's PaLM 2 already demonstrating promising results and finding integration into a variety of Google products[^9].

While the spotlight often falls on these high-performance models, an energetic and inventive open-source community is consistently pushing the boundaries of LLM advancements. Significant progress is visible in projects like Alpaca[^10] and Vicuna[^11].

The success of these initiatives provides a tangible embodiment of the principle "less is more," a concept eloquently showcased in the paper "Less Is More for Alignment"[^12]. These models illustrate that the quality of training data can often supersede quantity. A case in point is LiMA, which was trained on a mere 1000 examples using the LLaMA 65B model[^12], yet it outperformed Alpaca, which was trained with 52K instructing-following examples[^10].

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-52.png" width=75% />

  - Source: LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment[^12]

This finding offers a crucial lesson for the development of future large language models: a high-quality, tailored dataset may yield more significant benefits than merely possessing a large quantity of data. The commendable performance of models like Alpaca, Vicuna, and LIMA serves as proof of this principle.

While GPT4All-J[^13] and Dolly[^14] may not rank as high performers currently, they are notable for offering LLM access under the Apache 2.0 license, which makes them commercially viable. Despite their current performance constraints, these models hold promise as potential building blocks for future advancements in the AI landscape. Furthermore, the release of a 1.2 trillion token dataset by RedPajama[^15] brings further progress within reach.

## Augment LLM

LLMs excel at tasks such as basic reasoning, interpreting code, and following instructions. However, they often fall short in areas such as multi-step reasoning, using external tools, and understanding domain-specific knowledge. Additionally, their performance may not be optimal if they are used as all-purpose models without any specific fine-tuning. In the following sections, we will explore recent studies and experiments that provide more insight into these issues.

### Unleash the Potential

To enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we primarily focus on two strategies: **in-context learning** and **fine-tuning**.

In-context learning is a method that leverages the knowledge already present in a pre-trained model to perform a specific task without additional training. This is achieved by providing a well-designed instruction and/or context to the model, which guides it to generate the desired output based on its existing knowledge.[^16] In-context learning has shown impressive results in various tasks, such as program synthesis, arithmetic, and symbolic reasoning. However, it is often limited by the model's ability to generalize to new or more complex tasks, and it is not universally applicable to all NLP tasks.

Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is a process of adapting a pre-trained LLM to a specific task by training it further on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This allows the model to specialize in the target task and improve its performance. Fine-tuning has been used to enhance LLMs' performance in various domains, such as code synthesis, text-to-SQL[^17] capabilities, and conversational recommendation. By fine-tuning on a reserved segment of the dataset, performance can be improved on a specific task, although it may underperform on others.

#### In-context learning

To understand in-context learning, let's consider an interaction with GPT-3:

```
Q: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?

A: The answer (arabic numerals) is
(Output) 8
```

- Example is from the paper: Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Reasoners[^16]

In this dialogue, the question is asked without any prior context or instructions. Unsurprisingly, GPT-3's response is inaccurate. This type of questioning, without any preparatory context, is known as the **zero-shot** approach.

An alternate method to improve response accuracy is the **few-shot** approach, where we establish a context with examples before asking the question:

```
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?

A: The answer is 11.

Q: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?

A: (Output) The answer is 8.
```

Despite the additional context, GPT-3 continues to provide an incorrect answer. So how to solve it?

**Chain of Thought Prompting**

The reason that GPT-3 or any Large Language model struggle with tasks, like we illustrated above, is that the model requires deliberate thinking in multiple steps. Their ability in accomplishing such tasks remains less than satisfactory, and augmenting the model size doesn't considerably improve performance.

One strategy that has been proved works really well is called  **Chain of Thought(CoT)**  which mirrors human cognition by integrating the 'thinking process' within the prompt. Here is an refined prompt with the previous example:

```
Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis balls. How many tennis balls does he have now?

A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.

Q: A juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls, and half of the golf balls are blue. How many blue golf balls are there?

A:(Output) The juggler can juggle 16 balls. Half of the balls are golf balls. So there are 16 / 2 = 8 golf balls. Half of the golf balls are blue. So there are 8 / 2 = 4 blue golf balls. The answer is 4.
```

This strategy is demonstrated in the study _Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models_[^18], which significantly enhances large language models' (LLMs) ability to perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps. It results in a 40% performance improvement for PaLM on GSM8K tasks.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-53.png" width=60% />

  - [GSM8K](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math) consists of 8.5K high quality grade school math problems created by human problem writers. These problems take between 2 and 8 steps to solve, and solutions primarily involve performing a sequence of elementary calculations using basic arithmetic operations (+ - / \*) to reach the final answer.

However, it's important to note that CoT prompting isn't a universal performance enhancer. Another conclusion from the study showed that the model's problem-solving rate doesn't increase until the model size reaches a specific threshold. Intriguingly, it was discovered that CoT prompting can actually hamper the performance of smaller models.[^19]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-54.png" width=70% />

- Source: Challenging [BIG-Bench Tasks](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench) and Whether Chain-of-Thought Can Solve Them[^19]
  - BIG-Bench tasks cover a wide range of categories, including traditional NLP tasks, logic, math, code, understanding the world, understanding humans, scientific and technical understanding, and others.

The effectiveness of CoT prompting isn't limited to situations where examples are provided. It's been found that this strategy can also be highly effective in the zero-shot setting, where the model is simply asked to think through a problem. For instance, when a phrase like "Let's think step by step" is added to a question, it can dramatically boost accuracy for the [multistep arithmetic problem](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench/tree/main/bigbench/benchmark_tasks/multistep_arithmetic) from 17.7% to 78.7%[^16]. Moreover, using the phrase "Let's work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have the right answer" can further increase accuracy to an impressive 82.0%[^20]. In contrast, without CoT reasoning, the model's performance either does not improve or only gradually increases as the model size expands.

When do you need Chain-of-Thought Prompting for ChatGPT? [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03262)

Does CoT Prompting works for ChatGPT? Interestingly, the answer is no. One plausible explanation for this is that ChatGPT has already undergone training on tasks incorporating CoT and has memorized the instructions. As a result, it implicitly adheres to the chain of thought, even in the absence of explicit CoT prompting.

**Least-to-Most Prompting**[^21]

Least-to-Most Prompting, proposed by the same authors who introduced the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach, is an innovative method for enhancing the problem-solving capability of language models. The principle behind this approach is to decompose a complex problem into a sequence of simpler subproblems. The process comprises two sequential stages:

1. **Decomposition**. The prompt in this stage contains _constant examples_ that demonstrate the decomposition, followed by the specific question to be decomposed.
2. **Subproblem solving**. The prompt in this stage consists of three parts: (1) constant examples demonstrating how subproblems are solved; (2) a potentially empty list of previously answered subquestions and generated solutions, and (3) the question to be answered next.

The following illustration from the authors' work exemplifies this approach:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-55.png" width=85% />

The original problem is presented as the final subproblem. The solving process begins by providing the model with a prompt consisting of examples illustrating problem-solving techniques (not shown in the figure), followed by the first subproblem: "How long does each trip take?". The answer generated by the language model ("... each trip takes 5 minutes.") is added to the previous prompt, followed by the next subproblem. In this instance, the next subproblem is the original problem itself. This updated prompt is then inputted back into the language model, which generates the final solution.

The authors evaluated the performance of least-to-most prompting on three tasks: SCAN, DROP and GSM8K. They found that least-to-most prompting outperformed chain-of-thought prompting in both SCAN and DROP tasks. But in GSM8K task, the least-to-most prompting essentially improves chain-of-thought prompting in solving problems which need at least 5 steps to be solved(from 39.07% to 45.23%).

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-58.png" width=75% />
  - [SCAN](https://github.com/brendenlake/SCAN) consists of a set of commands and their corresponding action sequences. For example, command "look opposite right" is corresponding the action sequence: "TURN RIGHT TURN RIGHT LOOK".
  - [DROP](https://huggingface.co/datasets/drop) is a reading comprehension dataset that requires discrete reasoning over the content of paragraphs. For example, after reading a passage about a sports game, a question might be, "Who scored the most points?"

**Tree of Thought Prompting**[^22]

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-59.png" width=75% />

Building upon the principle of decomposing tasks into intermediate steps as demonstrated by the Least-to-Most prompting method, the Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting advances this strategy further. It not only deconstructs the problem into multiple steps, but it also maintains a 'tree of thoughts', with each 'thought' representing a state encapsulating a partial solution, given the input and the sequence of thoughts thus far.

A specific instantiation of ToT involves answering four questions: 1) How to **decompose** the intermediate process into thought steps; 2) How to **generate** potential thoughts from each state; 3) How to heuristically **evaluate** states; 4) What **search** algorithm to use.

Take the task game of 24 as an example. ToT first ask LLM the possible next steps and then evaluates each thought candidate as "sure/maybe/impossible" with regard to reaching 24 in a BFS fashion. Each step, it only keeps the best five candidates. This approach allows for deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-60.png)

As a result, ToT achieved a higher success rate of 74%. CoT(best of 100) had a success rate of 49%, while Input-Output prompting(best of 100) had a lower success rate of 33%. Besides, the error analysis showed that CoT had the highest failure rate at the first step, with 60% of samples failing, while ToT (b=5) had the highest failure rate at the second step, with 47% of samples failing.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-61.png)

The experiments demonstrate that ToT significantly enhances language models' problem-solving abilities on three tasks requiring non-trivial planning or search: Game of 24, Creative Writing, and Crosswords. However, the evaluation involves specific prompts tailored to each task to achieve good performance, which highlights some limitations of the method. Nonetheless, the results are promising and suggest new ways of using language models for complex problem-solving. I believes that this paper represents a small step in a new direction where language models are mixed with programming and algorithms. Future studies are expected to improve the method and make it more automatic with less intervention required in the process.

The paper Rethinking the Role of Demonstrations: What Makes In-Context Learning Work? [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12837) proposed some interesting ideas such as
- the correctness of the examples in few-shot doesn't hurt the accuracy of the answer a lot.
	- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-43.png)
- you don't need to put lots of examples into the context, usually 4 is good start.
	- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-44.png)
- The reason that in-context learning work might be:
	1. **The input-label mapping**, i.e., whether each input $x_i$ is paired with a correct label $y_i$.
	2. **The distribution of the input text**, i.e., the underlying distribution that $x_1 ...x_k$ are from.
	3. **The label space**, i.e., the space covered by $y_1 ...y_k$.
	4. **The format**—specifically, the use of input-label pairing as the format.

The paper Larger language models do in-context learning differently[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03846) did a more comprehensive research and find that large models can override the prior knowledge from pretraining with input-label mappings presented in-context. Small model, on the other hand do not flip their predictions and thus are unable to override semantic priors.

#### Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning strategies, specifically **full-parameter fine-tuning** and **efficient fine-tuning**, have been leveraged to adapt large pre-trained language models to specific tasks or domains.

**Full-parameter fine-tuning** uses the pre-trained model as an initialization point and further trains it with a new dataset. Despite its effectiveness, this approach necessitates considerable computational resources and may not be practical, particularly as models grow larger. It also presents scaling challenges for multiple tasks, as it requires training distinct instances of the model for each task.

**Efficient fine-tuning**, our primary area of interest, attempts to mitigate the limitations of full fine-tuning by adapting Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) using fewer parameters and reducing computational overhead. Techniques such as adapters—small neural network modules inserted into pre-trained models to enhance task-specific performance—are commonly employed. Other methods include pruning, quantization, and distillation, aiming to decrease the model's parameter count without significantly compromising its performance. As demonstrated in the paper _Exploring Efficient-tuning Methods in Self-supervised Speech Models_[^23], adapters can match the performance of full-model fine-tuning with an impressive 90% reduction in parameters for each downstream task.

The landscape of efficient fine-tuning has recently been enriched by initiatives such as Alpaca[^10], Vicuna[^11], and LIMA[^12]. These projects have employed LoRA[^24] to adapt the LLaMA[^25] model, an open-source LLM released by Meta in March 2023. Here's a brief overview of these projects:

- **Alpaca**: This initiative fine-tuned the 7B-parameter LLaMA model at a cost of less than $100. The process was completed in just 3 hours on eight 80GB A100s. Starting with 175 human-written instruction-output pairs from the [self-instruct seed set](https://\frac{github.com}{\frac{yizhongw}{self-instruct), the team expanded the dataset to include 52K unique records using OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` API, at a cost of less than $500.

- **Vicuna**: This project adapted the 13B-parameter LLaMA model using roughly 70K user-shared conversations collected from ShareGPT.com via public APIs. The training was conducted on eight A100 GPUs with 80GB memory, incurring a cost of approximately $300.

- **LIMA**: This initiative fine-tuned the largest variant of the LLaMA model, a 65B-parameter version, using 1000 carefully curated training examples. While Meta has not disclosed the associated training costs, they are likely to be substantial given the size of the model and the scale of the other projects.

Despite Meta's usage restrictions on LLaMA, the open-source community has responded with freely available models like GPT4All-J[^13], Dolly v2[^14], and the high-performing Falcon[^26]. Particularly noteworthy is Falcon, a 40B-parameter model released under the Apache 2.0 license.

Efficient fine-tuning is a significant opportunity for organizations like ours. While we may not have the resources to pre-train a model from scratch, we can still adapt existing models to excel at tasks within our domain. This strategy is not only resource-efficient but also encourages us to develop our own dataset—a process that could yield a significant asset for our company.

### Enhance the Capability

In this section, we delve into two crucial strategies that can augment a language model's capacity by enabling it to call external APIs and fetch additional information for enriching its responses.

Firstly, we examine the fine-tuning approach, which can improve the model's data retrieval abilities. This strategy, utilizing external tools such as calculators, web browsers, APIs, databases, can empower the model to execute more complex tasks during inference.

Secondly, we explore the technique of structuring prompts in a manner that guides the model to follow a sequence of steps and produce outputs in specific data formats. This allows the calling function to take appropriate actions based on the model's output. A prominent framework that implements this strategy is Langchain, which we will discuss in detail later in this section.

#### Fine-tune with retrieval

WebGPT[^27], a concept introduced in a paper by OpenAI at the end of 2021, entails fine-tuning GPT-3 to respond to long-form questions using a text-based web browsing environment for data retrieval. This gives the model the ability to search and navigate the web.

The system is trained on a dataset of question-answer pairs using imitation learning, which involves recording the actions taken by humans to answer questions and using them as training data for the model. Human feedback is used to evaluate the accuracy and relevance of the final response generated by WebGPT, which is then used to adjust the parameters of both the main model and the reward model using reinforcement learning.

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-69.png)
- The illustration above demonstrates how human operators prepare the training dataset. Initially, they select a question and input relevant keywords to conduct a search. Subsequently, they click on links and select paragraphs pertinent to the question. Once the search is completed, they click the `Done quoting` button to finalize the process.

During inference, WebGPT generates queries based on input questions and sends them to a simulated web browser using an automation library such as Playwright or Puppeteer. The browser returns relevant references that WebGPT uses to refine its initial answer, combining it with pre-trained knowledge.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-74.png" width=65% />
- In this example, WebGPT initiates a search for "Joe Biden", clicks on a Wikipedia link, quotes a relevant paragraph, and uses that information to formulate an answer to the question. From the user's perspective, only the question and answer are visible, masking the underlying processes.

While WebGPT expands the language model's knowledge beyond its training data, it lacks the comprehensiveness required for complex tasks. Toolformer[^28] extends this approach by empowering the language model to use additional tools, such as calculators and simple API calls, enhancing its problem-solving flexibility.

Unlike WebGPT, which relies heavily on human involvement for generating training data and implementing reinforcement learning, Toolformer adopts a distinct strategy. It initially prompts GPT-3 to produce question-answer pairs based on a specific template. It then retains only the data where the answers are correct when compared to those generated without tool-related prompts (`[]`). Here is an example of the prompt that Toolformer uses to generate training data:

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-78.png" width=70% />

Let's consider an example of inference using Toolformer. Suppose the question is: "I have 5 CAD, how much can I exchange for CNY?". In response, Toolformer initially lays out an intro with "5 CAD can exchange", followed by a `Query` using `CAD USD Exchange rate` as the parameter for the web browser. Once the exchange rate, `1 CAD = 5.2 CNY`, is retrieved, the model uses a `Calculator` with the parameter `5x5.2`. The final result, 26 CNY, is then appended at the end. For the end-user, the intermediate steps remain hidden, and they simply see the final answer: `5 CAD can exchange 26 CNY`.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-76.png" width=65% />

The evaluation of Toolformer involved using a 6.7B parameter GPT-J model that was fine-tuned on a large number of sampled API calls. The results showed that Toolformer significantly improved the zero-shot performance of the GPT-J model on a range of downstream tasks, including LAMA and Math Benchmarks. In fact, Toolformer even outperformed the much larger GPT-3 model on these tasks. Furthermore, the gap between model predictions with and without API calls remained high even for larger models, indicating that Toolformer's performance improvement is not limited to smaller models.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-79.png" width=75% />

However, constantly updating the dataset and retraining the model to recognize APIs can be impractical and expensive, especially with a large number of APIs. Gorilla[^29] is fine-tuned using LLaMA-7B-based model with document retrieval using a specific dataset. The model is trained to understand the structure and content of API documentation, which enables it to generate accurate input arguments and reduce hallucination errors. Moreover, its retrieval-aware training lets it adapt to changes in API documentation.

Gorilla's training includes a prompt in the instruction-tuned dataset appended with `"Use this API documentation for reference: <retrieved_API_doc_JSON>"` , which includes a JSON file of retrieved API documentation. This allows Gorilla to learn how to parse the second half of the question and answer the first half by retrieving relevant information from the API documentation. And it can adapt to the changes in API documentation and improve its performance from in-context learning.

Here are the example of the dataset that Gorilla uses for information retrieval training:

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-81.png" width=68% />

During inference, Gorilla retrieves the latest API documentation stored in the API Database using either BM25 or GPT-Index. The retrieved API documentation is then combined with the user prompt and a message stating `"Use this API documentation for reference:"`. This combined input is fed to Gorilla, which uses the retrieved information from the API documentation to generate an accurate API call based on the input prompt. This process allows Gorilla to generate precise and reliable API calls that can interact with various tools and services.

#### Prompt Engineering

So far, we've covered multiple methods for augmenting language models, with a primary focus on fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning has its drawbacks—it requires a comprehensive dataset, which may not always be readily available, and certain popular models, such as GPT-4 and Claude, do not support this technique. Prompt engineering is an emerging solution to these challenges. This technique doesn't modify the pre-trained model but instead enhances the model's capabilities by interacting with it through dynamic prompts. As previously noted, Gorilla dynamically incorporates API documentation into prompts, which enables the model to generate API call code based on these references. In this section, we'll delve deeper into prompt engineering and discuss ways of enhancing language models without resorting to fine-tuning.

Prompt engineering primarily uses three strategies: 1) augmenting the model with documents; 2) enhancing the model through a chain of calls; and 3) enabling the model to utilize external tools such as a web browser. Let's take a closer look at each of these strategies.

**Augment model with documents

The power of a language model is somewhat constrained by its limited context window, which only allows it to inspect a few thousand words at a time. So how do we enhance the model's ability to answer questions based on the entirety of a given document? The answer lies in the effective use of **embeddings** and **vector databases**.

Embeddings are powerful tools that generate numerical representations of texts, effectively capturing their semantic meanings.

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-82.png" width=75% />

The beauty of embeddings is that their numerical similarity often corresponds to semantic similarity. For instance, the embedding vector of "canine companions say" is likely to be numerically closer to the vector of “woof” than to that of "meow."[^30]

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-84.png" width=60% />
- An

Vector databases leverage a mix of algorithms that contribute to Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, optimizing vector similarity searches through techniques like hashing, quantization, or graph-based search[^31]. Here's a common pipeline for a vector database

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-85.png" width=70% />

In practical applications, documents are typically divided into smaller chunks to accommodate the language model's prompt size limitations. Each chunk is then assigned an embedding and stored in a vector database. The database's index becomes critical for identifying the most relevant chunks for any incoming query.

For each query received, an embedding is created. This query embedding is then compared with all the vectors stored in the database to select the most relevant chunks.

Finally, both the query and the selected chunks are input into the prompt, resulting in the generation of a well-informed answer.

We will further explore this strategy in the section titled _Development of AI-powered Conversational Search_, which discusses the first application we developed using these techniques.

**Enhance the model with chains**

At its core, chains involve using the output of one Language Learning Model (LLM) as the input for the subsequent chain (LLM). Below is an illustration of a simple sequential chain:

- <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erictt/llm-tech-report/main/assets/report-88.png" width=75% />

The developer's task is to effectively connect two chain calls by applying specific rules to format the data output from the first chain so we can pass it to the subsequent chain. Let's examine a more complex chain, the [Router Chains](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/generic/router.html), to better understand this process. Router Chains are used to direct queries to different downstreams. Assume we have four different prompts corresponding to four subjects: physics, math, history, and computer science. We want the Language Learning Model (LLM) to act as an expert in each subject to answer relevant questions. In the first chain of Router Chains, the LLM determines the subject to which the question pertains. The following is an example of a router prompt template:

```
Given a raw text input to a language model select the model prompt best suited for the input. You will be given the names of the available prompts and a description of what the prompt is best suited for. You may also revise the original input if you think that revising it will ultimately lead to a better response from the language model.

<< FORMATTING >>
Return a markdown code snippet with a JSON object formatted to look like:
\`\`\`json
{{{{
    "destination": string \ name of the prompt to use or "DEFAULT"
    "next_inputs": string \ a potentially modified version of the original input
}}}}
\`\`\`

REMEMBER: "destination" MUST be one of the candidate prompt names specified below OR it can be "DEFAULT" if the input is not well suited for any of the candidate prompts.
REMEMBER: "next_inputs" can just be the original input if you don't think any modifications are needed.

<< CANDIDATE PROMPTS >>
physics:Good for answering questions about physics
math:Good for answering math questions
history:Good for answering history questions
computer science:Good for answering computer science questions

<< INPUT >>
{{input}}

<< OUTPUT (remember to include the ```json)>>
```

For a question like `what is 2 + 2`, the expected output would be a JSON object: `{destination: "math", next_inputs: "what is 2 + 2"}`. With this, we can then prompt the LLM with a revised query:

```
You are a very good mathematician. You are great at answering math questions. You are so good because you are able to break down hard problems into their component parts, answer the component parts, and then put them together to answer the broader question.

Here is a question:
what is 2 + 2
```

The key takeaway is that chains are a potent tool for extending the functionality of language models by breaking down the problem into several intermediate states. This way, the language model can concentrate on one simple task at a time.

**Leverage external tools**

External tools can also be utilized in conjunction with language models to enhance their capabilities. In these scenarios, the language model generates output in a JSON format, which is then used by the tools to perform specific actions. The results are then fed back to the language model for follow-up processing.

Consider an example where we have two tools, a calculator and a search tool (like Wikipedia), and we pose the question: `What is 25% of 300?`. Here is how Langchain makes sequential calls:

1. The language model is initially prompted to determine which tool to use. It is given a brief description of each tool and the format of the JSON blob to specify the tool and the input for the tool. Here is the prompt:

```
System: Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

Calculator: Useful for when you need to answer questions about math.
Wikipedia: A wrapper around Wikipedia. Useful for when you need to answer general questions about people, places, companies, facts, historical events, or other subjects. Input should be a search query.

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the \"action\" field are: Calculator, Wikipedia

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,
  \"action_input\": $INPUT
}
\`\`\`

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
\`\`\`
$JSON_BLOB
\`\`\`
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.
Human: What is the 25% of 300?

```

2. The language model responds by determining that the question involves a mathematical calculation and accordingly selects the "Calculator" tool. It generates a JSON blob indicating the action to be performed by the tool:

```
Thought: We need to calculate 25% of 300, which involves multiplication and division.

Action:
\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": \"Calculator\",
  \"action_input\": \"300*0.25\"
}
\`\`\`

```

3. The Calculator tool is then used to perform the operation `300*0.25`, which results in the answer: 75.0.
4. The obtained result is then fed back to the language model. The language model is again presented with the original prompt, along with the previous thought process, the action taken, and the observation (result):

```
System: Answer the following questions as best you can. You have access to the following tools:

Calculator: Useful for when you need to answer questions about math.
Wikipedia: A wrapper around Wikipedia. Useful for when you need to answer general questions about people, places, companies, facts, historical events, or other subjects. Input should be a search query.

The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).

The only values that should be in the \"action\" field are: Calculator, Wikipedia

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:

\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": $TOOL_NAME,
  \"action_input\": $INPUT
}
\`\`\`

ALWAYS use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action:
\`\`\`
$JSON_BLOB
\`\`\`
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

Begin! Reminder to always use the exact characters `Final Answer` when responding.
Human: What is the 25% of 300?

This was your previous work (but I haven't seen any of it! I only see what you return as final answer):
Thought: We need to calculate 25% of 300, which involves multiplication and division.

Action:
\`\`\`
{
  \"action\": \"Calculator\",
  \"action_input\": \"300*0.25\"
}
\`\`\`


Observation: Answer: 75.0
Thought:

```

5. Finally, the language model formulates the final response by stating that it now has the answer to the question and provides the final answer: 75.0.

```
We have the answer to the question.
Final Answer: 75.0
```

For a deeper and more practical understanding of how to effectively use chains and agents, I highly recommend the short course offered by deeplearning.ai: [https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/langchain/). This course covers the main modules provided by Langchain and also provides detailed playbooks for hands-on experience.

## Model Evaluation

Evaluating the performance of AI models, especially language models, often involves the use of both automatically generated and manually curated test datasets. The language model itself can be a useful tool in creating these datasets. For instance, the model can be asked to produce a set of responses to specific prompts, which can then be used as part of the evaluation process.

Here's an example workflow:

1. **Test Dataset Generation**: Use the language model to generate a set of prompts and expected responses. This can be done by running a diverse set of prompts through the model and storing the model's responses as the 'expected' outcomes.

2. **Model Evaluation**: Once the test dataset is prepared, it can be used to evaluate the performance of the model. Run the same prompts through the model under evaluation and compare the responses with the 'expected' responses from the test dataset.

3. **Performance Metrics**: Use suitable metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to quantify the performance of the model. The choice of metrics will depend on the specific use-case and the nature of the responses.

4. **Iterative Improvement**: The results of the evaluation can provide valuable insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses, informing further development and refinement of the model.

Remember that ongoing monitoring and evaluation are vital. As the model's prompts and implementation strategies evolve over time, it's important to continually reassess the model's performance. This will ensure that any changes in performance, whether improvements or degradations, are promptly identified and addressed.

## Conclusion

In the dynamic landscape of AI, new advancements and innovations continually emerge. Despite the proficiency of advanced models like GPT-4, they still have limitations that smaller, fine-tuned models can address more cost-effectively and quickly. Many projects have effectively harnessed language models while simultaneously extending their capabilities through prompt engineering, such as Langchain[^32] and Auto-GPT[^33]. These developments present abundant opportunities for small companies to create domain-specific applications that broad-purpose models cannot address.
